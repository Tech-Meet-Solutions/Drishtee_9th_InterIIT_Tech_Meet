# Drishtee_9th_InterIIT_Tech_Meet
This repository is a collection of files including ppts and mid review documentation created by the IIT Bombay contingent for the Drishtee's Tech-Led Innovation For Rural Entrepreneurs challenge for Inter-IIT Tech Meet 9.0 by IIT Guwahati.

# Problem Statement
Currently farmers face a shortage of warehouses and cold storage systems, unfair pricing for their produce, and low profitability. These issues, caused by a huge system of intermediaries, eventually lead to migration of rural youth to urban areas for better opportunities. They also face issues in procuring loans from banks, stemming from the lack of a credit history. These issues can collectively be solved through improvements in agricultural technologies to enhance farmer capacities, providing them incentive to develop their livelihood within their village.

# Solution Overview
We propose the creation of a robust supply chain that is managed and operated by rural people with the help of the framework provided to them. The framework includes all processes, logistics as well as data that is used to provide them credit-based loans. In order to make the framework more effective, various value-added processes are added to the framework that includes the use of alternative ways to generate income from waste like polyhouses, reverse supply chain, etc.
